        <h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF BOOKS IN OUR LIVES</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes to do. I keep a list of all books completed, along with personal thoughts
        on my interpretation of the story. It’s a small book journal I picked up at Barnes & Nobles and I absolutely
        love it. Books are an important part of life, but busy schedules keep most people from reading a book in their
        spare time. As children we are encouraged to read, but as most reach adulthood, books are often left behind.
    </p>
    <p>With the amount of time people spend on social sites like face book, snapchat, Instagram (usually on their
        phones), they could spend that time reading a chapter book. A book helps us to use our imagination and forces
        the reader to use mental images, while creating scenarios based on characters as well as the plot. The
        importance of reading helps us to focus on what someone else is communicating; it exercises the mind. The mind
        is a muscle and develops over time, enabling its ability to understand the written words. The more you read, the
        easier it becomes, not to mention…it gets the creative juices flowing. It also helps to expand your vocabulary
        while getting self-educated. A couple of interesting facts; self-made millionaires read approximately 2 or more
        books a month, while CEO’s read approximately 5 books a month. Reading makes us more intelligent. It boosts
        brain power while helping to articulate your thoughts; it’s a win-win for all.</p>
    <p>
        Great books have the power to change your life…if you let it. It can lift your spirits, and help guide you.
        You’ll find it can give you the sense of belonging, as others have similar feelings. Books share a variety of
        things; an author’s story, point of view, theory, facts, emotions and more. It teaches you to listen, which is
        also an important part of reading. Books give the readers an opportunity to think about what was read, with no
        right or wrong way to interpret the written story. Sometimes it helps us to realize we are all human, often
        deepening our gratitude.</p>
    <p>
        Reading has declined in the U.S. Close to a quarter of American adults don’t read books at all; according to Pew
        Research Center. The national assessment of adult literacy shows over 40% of adults residing in the U.S. has
        basic or below the basic literacy skills. For those with children, having low literacy skills, the battle
        remains…they’ll (children) have a 72% chance of being at the lowest reading levels themselves, furthering
        absenteeism and drop-out rates. I find these statistics alarming when thinking of OUR future America. For more
        facts on the decline of Literacy and more info on how you can help, please visit …

        designated area, if you’re looking to take one home. Otherwise, apply for a library card and check one out for
        free. You can also check out book clubs online.</p>
