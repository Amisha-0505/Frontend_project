        <h1>The 7 Wonders Of The World</h1>
        <p class="box1">For centuries, human civilizations across the world have built and created cities, buildings,
            monuments,
            tombs, temples, churches, mosques, and other structures that continue to inspire awe in millions. Narrowing
            down the world's wonders to only seven is a difficult task. Luckily, the New7Wonders Foundation took the
            initiative to compose a list of the "new" seven wonders of the world by narrowing down a list of 200
            monuments from around the world, including some of the world's most famous landmarks. 21 finalists were
            selected from this list, and the top seven were selected by popular vote. These are the seven new wonders of
            the world: Chichén Itzá in Mexico, Christ the Redeemer Statue in Brazil, the Colosseum in Italy, the Great
            Wall of China, Machu Picchu in Peru, Petra in Jordan, and the Taj Mahal in India. Each one offers a unique
            experience to those lucky enough to see them. From awe-inspiring design elements to hidden stories behind
            each structure, these wonders remain relevant today as they continue to capture imaginations across the
            globe.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Great Pyramid of Giza has also been added to the list. However, it is an honorary candidate and not one of
        the seven wonders.</p>
